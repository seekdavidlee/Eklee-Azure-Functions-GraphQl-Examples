# Introduction

This example demostrates the use of the in-memory resolver for handling your Models. In practice, we would not be using this type of resolver for any production workloads. However, this example is useful for understanding how to get started quickly for setting up our mutations, queries and schema for other types of resolvers.

## Setup

There's nothing to setup. You can run the solution directly and be able to use the Postman example to call into it.
