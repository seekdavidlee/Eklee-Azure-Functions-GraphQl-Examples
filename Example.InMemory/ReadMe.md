# Introduction

This example demostrates the use of the in-memory resolver for handling your Models. In practice, for any production senarios, we will not be using this type of resolver. However, the example is useful for understanding how to setup your mutations, queries and schema for other types of resolvers.

# Setup

There's nothing to setup. You can run the solution directly and be able to use the Postman example to call into it.
