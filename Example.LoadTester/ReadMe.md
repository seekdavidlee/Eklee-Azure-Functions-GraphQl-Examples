# Introduction

This example demostrates the use of a simple load testing tool to test your GraphQL API.

## Setup

This is tool is still being developed and subject to changes. However, if you like to try it use the following command args in your project startup. Be sure to start the storage project.

```
-r "..\..\..\..\..\Example.Storage\LoadTest\ProductsOnly2.json" -g "http://localhost:7071/api/teststorage" -o C:\dev\reports
```

For now, you can reference the checked in json example and infer the usage. More documentation will be provided soon.
